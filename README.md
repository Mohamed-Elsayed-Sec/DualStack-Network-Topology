# DualStack Network Topology Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains my first documented networking projects, focused on designing and analyzing network topologies using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. The work presented here reflects the beginning of my journey into professional network engineering and cybersecurity, with an emphasis on structured design, address planning, and technical documentation.

## Project 1: IPv4 Network Topology

This project demonstrates a hierarchical IPv4 network topology consisting of nine routers connected through multiple subnets. Each subnet uses a /24 CIDR block, and the topology was designed to simulate a realistic home or lab environment.

### Key Features

- Structured router hierarchy
- Subnet allocation using IPv4
- Visual design created using Miro

### File

- `IPv4-topology.jpeg`: Diagram of the IPv4 network

## Project 2: IPv6 Network Topology

This project builds on the IPv4 design and introduces a dual-stack approach using IPv6. Each router is assigned a unique /64 prefix, and the topology includes multiple subnets to demonstrate scalable address planning and hierarchical routing.

### Key Features

- IPv6 prefix allocation per router
- Subnet segmentation and expansion
- Visual design created using Miro

### File

- `IPv6-topology.jpeg`: Diagram of the IPv6 network

## Objectives

- Apply foundational concepts in IPv4 and IPv6 subnetting
- Design and document router interconnectivity
- Establish a professional approach to network visualization and version control
