# IPv4 & IPv6 Network Topology

This is my first networking project on GitHub.  
It represents a **dual-stack (IPv4 & IPv6) network topology** with multiple routers and subnets.  
The diagrams were designed using [Miro](https://miro.com/).

### IPv6 Topology

## Details
- Routers: R1 to R9
- IPv4 Addressing: /24 subnets
- IPv6 Addressing: /64 subnets (Documentation prefix `2001:db8::/32` used for example)

## How to Use
- Can be implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.
- Assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as shown in the diagrams.
- Configure dual-stack routing (static or dynamic) to ensure connectivity.
